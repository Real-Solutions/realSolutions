# Real-Solutions

A web application where a user can view real estate listings and submit offers, have the offers go to all appropriate parties, and the the seller can view on all offers in one area.

## Problem Domain

When a seller lists their home, many times there are multiple offers that come in.  For the agent, presenting those offers can be cumbersome and time consuming.  Having a single source of collecting these offers can make it simpler and faster in viewing these offers.  It also makes the decision making process easier and more efficient for all parties involved.
